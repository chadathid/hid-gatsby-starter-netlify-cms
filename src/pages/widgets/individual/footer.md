  A footer serves site visitors who arrive at the bottom of a page without
  finding what they want.

  Sometimes used for additional navigation items which are significantly less important global items but yet need to be there (i.e., terms of service or privacy policies).

# **Guidelines**

Footer guidance will change depending on the product being developed for example a external website user will have different needs from a footer than an internal web application. Generally, the footer is not a catch-all for anything you do not know where else to put. Since users rarely make it to the end of pages, it should be minimized to only the things users expect to find as in the items below.

* Copyright (Be sure this is updated programmatically to display the correct date at all times)
* Link to Terms of Service
* Link to Privacy Policy
* Software version

Less frequently used because it depends on the platform and audience.

* Contact
* Sitemap
* Navigation
* Mission Vision

# **Accessibility**

Footer is used at the bottom of an application. It provides buttons that link to company information and other important links to secondary pages that may not be part of the Header navigation structure.
