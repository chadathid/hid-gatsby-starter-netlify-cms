title: File Uploader
description: >
  File uploaders allow users to upload content of their own. A file uploader is
  commonly found in forms, but can also live as a standalone element. We have 3
  variants of file uploader buttons. A basic button, a button with text and an
  icon, and a button that is icon only.

# **Guidelines**

**When to use**

Plain text and text with icon buttons should be used in forms and in text. Icon-only buttons can be used in a text editor or other situations where space is limited.

There are two major components of the file uploader.

**Button** - These are the elements the user interacts with to initiate the upload of a file.

**Documents** - These are the files being uploaded. They have several states in which they can be displayed such as Loading, success, uploaded, and error.
