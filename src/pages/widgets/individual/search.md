description: Search is one of the most important features in many UIs. Users
  expect it to be fast, intelligent, and simple. With global search, users can
  get right to records and apps by entering simple keywords or using powerful
  advanced search features. In-context search is where users can refine the
  content on a page to find the correct information without having to
  context-shift or navigate away as with global search.

# **Guidelines**

* The Search Input should be wide enough to fit common search queries or terms.
* Provide placeholder examples or auto suggested results to help users understand what they are searching.
* Display the Search Input prominently, to ensure it is discoverable and do not hide the Search input behind an icon.
* It is recommended to have only one Search per page.
* Search input should fit into one line. Do not use multiline, Truncate or Wrap the text within the Search input.

**Placement**

* To filter within a section or page always place the search directly above the section. To inform the user that Search is refining the particular section alone.
* In case of a Global Search place it on the Top Right or in the Header.
