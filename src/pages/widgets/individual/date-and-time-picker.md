The date and time picker control are usedÂ to allow the user to select a date and time, and to display that date and time in the specified format. The date and time picker control makes it easy to work with dates and times because it handles a lot of the data validation automatically.

# **Accessibility**

* Enter dates manually by inputting text, without using the picker
* On the Docked Date Picker, the text field can be used for input.
* On Modal Date Picker, the input picker should be available from the calendar pickers via the edit icon.
* The edit icon indicates the ability to switch to the mobile input picker.
- The date entry component offers two ways to enter a date:
    - Direct text entry into a text field
    - Through the date picker
* The calendar icon is the exclusive entry point for the date picker.
* Enter time selection manually using input fields
* Choose from multiple time formats including 24 hour clock view and AM/PM
* Time pickers should allow manual time entry through text input, rather than exclusively through the dial selector. This makes it easier for those using keyboard inputs rather than touchscreens.
