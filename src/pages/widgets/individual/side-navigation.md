# **Guidelines**

Side drawer navigations provide users with quick access to important sections of the interface. They can either be permanently on-screen or controlled by a navigation menu icon. The shell of this system is made up of the header and a left panel.

Navigation drawers are recommended for:

* Interface with five or more top-level destinations
* Interface with two or more levels of the navigation hierarchy
* Quick navigation between unrelated destinations
* The left panel does not support three tiers of navigation. If you have additional content to display beneath a sub-menu, use tabs within the page.

The left side drawer navigation contains secondary navigation and is positioned below the header and fixed to the left. Both links and sub-menus can be used in the side-nav and may be mixed together.

# **Variants**

**Expanded** - Navigation style with icons and their corresponding text giving greater clarity to the purpose of the menu items.

**Collapsed** - Navigation style where only icons are visible making the greatest use of space for content.
