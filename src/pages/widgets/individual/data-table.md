# **Guidelines**

Tables are used to organize data that is too detailed or complicated to be described adequately in the text, allowing the reader to quickly see the results. They can be used to highlight trends or patterns in the data and to make a manuscript more readable by removing numeric data from the text.

**Tables with Selections**

When Tables have items selected, the header of the Table changes: The Table Title area is replaced and highlighted blue, to show the actions that can be performed, for the items selected.

**Tables with Statuses**

Tables that contain information regarding users, will have rows that can change to different background colors to show the active status of that user. Each color indicates a different status that may or may not require the main active user to take action.

**Tables with Search**

Tables with Search fields allow the user to enter a keyword and search the table to display any data pertaining to the search phrase. The field is displayed at the top of the table, after the title, and before the other search controls.

If the user wants to clear the search, they will have to click on the “circle x” inside the field.

**Tables with Expanding / Collapsing Rows**

Tables can have rows that collapse or expand data. The functionality behaves similarly to an accordion, where the displaying row has a title (feature/attribute) with data pertaining to that attribute nested within.


**Tables with Display Options & Pagination**

Tables can have either a simple display option or a more robust pagination system that gives the user control of how much content they want to view.

There is also a pagination system for tables with pages upon pages of data. Applying pagination would allow the user to tab through finding data.

# **Accessibility**

- Make content digestible and scannable:
    - Keep headers clear and concise.
    - Include an a visual indicator for cells that don’t have content.
    - Give enough space for content to account for localization.
    - Wrap important content to multiple lines.
    - Truncate secondary information, especially if a user is going to get the full content upon click of a link in the table.


- Expand rows if the additional content is simple, doesn’t contain a lot of interaction and doesn’t take up more than 50% of the screen.
