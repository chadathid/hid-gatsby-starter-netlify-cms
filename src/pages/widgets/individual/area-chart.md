title: Area chart
description: >-
  An area chart is a good choice when you want to see volume change over a
  period of time, without focusing on specific data values. It gives a sense of
  summation of the quantitative data.

  Area chart is used to study data trends over time. It measures the trend over time by filling the area between the line segment and the x-axis with color.

  Area chart communicate the summation of data rather than represent individual data values.

# **Guidelines**

* Each area should have a unique color. Use transparent colors so information isn't obscured in the background.
* Always include a zero baseline on the y-axis. An Area graph that doesn't include a zero baseline is misleading.
* The legend is the key to the information. It should be positioned above the graph and in the same order as the sequence of the components.
* Always label your axes and include the units for the y-axis.
* On the y-axis, choose increments that are easy to follow. All values on the y-axis must be divisible by the increment itself.

**When to use**

**Overlapping Area chart** - This chart compares values between groups and shows the data overlapping.

**Stacked Area chart** - A stacked chart is used when tracking total value and to understand the breakdown of that total by groups.

**Do not use**

Avoid using area charts when there are more than 3 - 4 categories. In that case, use line charts.

Do not use the area chart if there are negative values.
