# **Guidelines**

The Inline Text editor is used exclusively in features that allow users to edit rich text content. It is primarily used for document and note creation or editing.

* Use self-explanatory icons for custom actions. Do not use a text label or combine a text label with an icon. As for all icons, offer a tooltip with a text label instead.
* All available actions are displayed in the toolbar. Elements can be added or removed from the header, depending on the use case. The Toolbar also contains the action to save the content.
* The toolbar is always visible and fixed, the user has access to all the action groups. To start typing, the user has to click inside the content area.
* The Content area allows a user to enter text, as well as other content, such as images or hyperlinks etc.

# **Accessibility**

* An Inline Editing pattern is applied to an entire section if all the information belongs to the same object, and is edited as a group. 
* Since there are dependencies between the fields in the section, the entire group is made editable.
