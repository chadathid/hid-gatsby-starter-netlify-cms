# **Guidelines**

The Inline Text editor is used exclusively in features that allow for users to edit rich text content. It is primarily used for document and note creation or editing.

* Use self-explanatory icons for custom actions. Do not use a text label, or combine a text label with and icon. As for all icons, offer a tooltip with a text label instead.
* All available actions are displayed in the toolbar. Elements can be add or removed from the header, depending on the use case. The Toolbar also contains the action to save the content.
* The toolbar is always visible and fixed and the user has access to all the action groups. To start typing, the user has to click inside the content area.
* The Content area allows a user to enter text, as well as other content, such as images or hyperlinks etc.
