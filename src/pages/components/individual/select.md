# **Guidelines**

The select component is typically used inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data whereas the dropdown component is used to filter or sort content on a page.

The select component’s appearance is decided by the browser that is being used while the dropdown component can be styled as needed.

**Do's**

* Always organize the list of options in a way that will make the most sense to the user based on the scenario. The list of options can be sorted alphabetically, numerically or by the most commonly selected option.
* Don’t overwhelm the user with too many options, try to avoid options that rarely get used.
* Use concise, descriptive labels so that users clearly know the purpose of the selection. For example, use a “Save to…” label for a list containing options such as “Cloud, Local drive, CD”.

**Don'ts**

* A Select is not a Dropdown, the select and dropdown components may behave similarly but in fact, they have different functions.
