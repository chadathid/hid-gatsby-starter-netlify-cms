# **G﻿uidelines**

* The first tab is the default or selected tab. They should be listed in a logical order of hierarchy or sequence based on user needs.Only one tab should be active at a time.
* Keep the labels short and scannable. It should indicate what is in the related tab section.
* Use tabs when there are 2-6 tab items and not more than that.

**Do not use**

* Avoid tabs when the user wants to compare and see multiple content at the same time. Use accordion instead.
* Do not use tab component as a form of primary page navigation.
* Do not use tabs to break user interaction into a series of steps. Instead use stepper.
* Don’t use tabs to group content that is dissimilar.
* Do not nest tab group within another tab group.
