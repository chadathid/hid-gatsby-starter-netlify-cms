# **Guidelines**

The breadcrumb component is a well-known secondary navigation pattern that shows hierarchy among content or traces a userâ€™s path. Breadcrumbs are space-efficient and high-utility design that enable users to move quickly up to a parent level or previous step.

**When to Use**

Breadcrumbs are very effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels. They are also highly effective in flows that contain multiple steps.

**Do not Use**

Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation.

# **Accessibility**

* Breadcrumbs are useful on large websites where pages have clearly defined hierarchy.
* These navigation patterns can allow users to easily backtrack through related pages, or the pathway they had taken to reach the current page.
* Breadcrumb helps search engineers navigate a website and find content to index. 
* Keep navigation breadcrumbs short, simple, and to the point. Include important keywords whenever possible.
