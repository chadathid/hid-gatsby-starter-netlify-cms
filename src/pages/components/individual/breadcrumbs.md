# **Guidelines**

The breadcrumb component is a well-known secondary navigation pattern that shows hierarchy among content or traces a userâ€™s path. Breadcrumbs are space-efficient and high-utility design that enable users to move quickly up to a parent level or previous step.

**When to Use**

Breadcrumbs are very effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a hierarchy of more than two levels. They are also highly effective in flows that contain multiple steps.\
\
**Do not Use**

Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation.
