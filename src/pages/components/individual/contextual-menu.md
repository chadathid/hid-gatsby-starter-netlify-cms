   This menu only offers a limited set of choices based on the application's current state.

# **Guidelines**

On desktop, the main interactions that reveal contextual menus include Right-clicking on a two-button mouse, Pressing the Control (Ctrl) button and then clicking or Two-finger click on a trackpad.\
\
For example, Right clicking on a highlighted text in Microsoft Word reveals a contextual menu that contains text-specific actions such as Copy or Spell Check.

* Include only the most commonly used commands that are appropriate in the current context.
* Use a hierarchical menu to organize a large set of options and group-related items.
* Context Menu is used for some common tasks and should not be used as the only means to complete a task. The contextual menu commands should also be available in the application's main menu.
* Don’t set a default item in a contextual menu.
* To avoid choice overload, limit the number of items within a contextual menu to 10 - 12 commands.
* Don’t hide irrelevant actions, disable them so that users won’t have to try to find where menu items disappeared.
