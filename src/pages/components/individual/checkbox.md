# **Guidelines**

Checkboxes are a fundamental input component typically represented by an empty box in the unselected state and a box with a check mark (hence the checkbox name) when selected.

**Click target**

Users should be able to select the checkbox by clicking on the box directly.\
\
**Default selection**

The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.\
\
**Labels**

Always use clear and concise labels for checkboxes. Be explicit about the results that will follow if the checkbox is selected. Labels should appear to the right of the checkboxes.

# **Accessibility**

* Toggle the checkbox to check and uncheck.
* Users should be able to select either the text label or the checkbox to select an option.
* The accessibility label for an individual checkbox is typically the same as its adjacent text label.
