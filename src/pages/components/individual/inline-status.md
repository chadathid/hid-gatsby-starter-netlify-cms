# **Guidelines**

Inline Status indicates a state or condition at a particular time and falls into five categories: info, success, warning, error and none.
 
**For example**: status can indicate that a request is Active, Pending, or Successful.

* Use Inline Status when users must address or be aware of important information while completing tasks.
* Use Inline Status to call out important status information for items in a list or specific properties on a record.
* Inline Status are contextual. They are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content and should be shown in close proximity to that element.

**When to use**

**Icon status** - use it to call out important status information for items in a list or specific properties on a record.

**Dot Badge with Label** - use this in table entries to avoid overuse of icons and unnecessary visual accents.

**Compact Dot Badge without Label** - use it to indicate that something is new or something has changed without showing a count.

**Do not use**

Inline Status is only used to provide advisory information to the user, do not use it for communicating high-priority information.

**These are some typical situations in which each color could be used:**


**Red** - Error status is used to alert a failed process or emergency alerts

**Orange** - Warning status is used to notify the user of an expiring license or process

**Green** - Success status is used to communicate that an update has been successfully completed

**Blue** - Info status is used to communicate a process in progress or current status or update

**Grey** - None status is used to notify users regarding a basic, general status where no further action is required.
The lowest level of severity is grey (neutral) and the highest level of severity, is red (Alert).

# **Accessibility**

* Use Status to communicate a step in a workflow or the state of an item.
* Place Status close to its subject to provide context and reference. It can be placed as an inline element or paired side by side as needed.
* Use label when the status it represents is unique, specific and critical for the user to know.
