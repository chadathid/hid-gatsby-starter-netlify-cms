# **Guidelines**

Radio buttons are used for individual, not multiple selections from a list of choices. Only one radio button can be selected at a time. When a new item is selected, the previous choice is automatically deselected.

**When to use**

​​Radio buttons should be used instead of checkboxes if only one item can be selected from a list.

**Form**

Can be used in forms on a full page, in modals, or on side panels.

**Selection in List**

Used to choose a single item within a data table or list.

# **Behavior**

# **Accessibility**

* The radio button has two states: selected and unselected. 
* There’s a brief but important interaction where the user changes the states of the buttons by selecting an option.
* Users should be able to select either the text label or the radio button to select an option. 
* Once selected, there is always one radio button selected in the group, users can change their selection, but they can’t unselect.
