# **Guidelines**

Use progress steppers to break a larger goal into manageable steps when it would otherwise be overwhelming for the user such as onboarding or payment flow.

* Use step labels to clearly describe the purpose of the step.
* Progress stepper tasks must have three or more steps.
* If a task has more than 6 steps, simplify it or break it up into multiple tasks.
* Inform the user where currently they are in the task flow as this will give them a sense of control.

**Anatomy**

A stepper helps indicate to the user where they are in the progress of completing a task.

**In Progress**

As the user progresses, the previous step is checked off.

**Completed**

When the user has completed the whole process of the task, the stepper will end with a green indicator for success.
