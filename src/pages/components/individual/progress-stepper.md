Use progress steppers to break a larger goal into manageable steps when it would otherwise be overwhelming for the user such as onboarding or payment flow.

* Use step labels to clearly describe the purpose of the step.
* Progress stepper tasks must have three or more steps.
* If a task has more than 6 steps, simplify it or break it up into multiple tasks.
* Inform the user where currently they are in the task flow as this will give them a sense of control.
