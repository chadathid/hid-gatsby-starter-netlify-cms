# **Guidelines**

Buttons are used primarily on action items.

* Some examples include Add, Save, Delete, and Login. Each page can have one or two primary buttons. 
* Any remaining calls-to-action must be represented as secondary buttons.
* Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. Use active verbs, such as Add or Delete.
* Use all-caps capitalization and never more than three (3) words for button labels.
* For sets of buttons, use specific labels, such as Save or Discard, instead of using **OK** and **Cancel**. This is particularly helpful when the user is confirming an action.

**When using Icons**

* Icons should always appear to the right of the text.
* Icons used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is taking.
* Icons must be the same color value as the text within a button.

**When to use**

Use a button when you are performing an action, such as: “submit,” “merge,” “create new,” “upload,” etc.

**Do not use**

Never use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

# **Variant**                      

**Primary** - Principal call-to-action within a page.

**Secondary** - Secondary calls-to-action within a page.

**Tertiary** - Links that should function like a button

**Warning** - Confirmation action that could have potentially destructive effects on data (delete, remove).

**Override** - Override of possible destructive action.

**With icons** - Icons can be used to augment communication of what the button does.

**Disabled** - Signals that the user cannot proceed until input data is collected.
