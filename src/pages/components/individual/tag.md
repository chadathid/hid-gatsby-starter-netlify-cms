title: Tag
description: Tags are used for web content that needs to be labeled,
  categorized, or organized using keywords that describe them. Tags are often
  used as a filter where all tags are in the same color, or used when content is
  mapped to multiple categories, where color is used to differentiate between
  categories

## **Guidelines**

* Multiple or single tags can be used to categorize items.
* Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from other tags.
* Use tags when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
* Tags can also be used as a method of filtering data, to show only items within that particular category.

**Type Style**\
Tag text should be set in sentence case, and should only have one word. However, if more than one is necessary, then connect the words using a hyphen with no spaces.\
\
**Structure**\
All tags have the same height. However, the width of tags varies based on the amount of content. All four corners of a tag are rounded with a 24px radius.
