title: Accordion
description: The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a
  small space through progressive disclosure. That is, the user gets key details
  about the underlying content and can choose to expand that content within the
  constraints of the accordion. Accordions work especially well on mobile
  interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.

# **Accessibility**

- An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each contain a title, content snippet, or thumbnail representing a section of content.
- Each header controls it’s associated content. The header also will have a control that can show / hide or expand / collapse the associated section.
-﻿ Accordions as mentioned can show or hide the content which reduces the need for scrolling the page when multiple sections are on the page. 
- Accordions can either be multi-expandable or single expandable.
