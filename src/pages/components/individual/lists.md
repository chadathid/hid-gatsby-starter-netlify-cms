# **Guidelines**

A list is a simple series of continuous, vertical indexes of related text or images in categories and subcategories. The most common forms of lists are ordered and unordered lists. Bulleted (unordered) lists are used when you don’t need to convey a specific order for list items. A list can be used for a number of things like storing items or deleting and adding items.

**When to use**

* Lists should be categorized in logical ways so that the content is easily scannable. Lists are often categorized as Alphabetical, Numerical and Chronological.
* A List should be used to convey simple information and hence for complex sets of data consider using a data table.
* Use sentence case and begin lists with a capital letter.
* Ordered lists are used when we want to convey hierarchy or priority between the list items and hence each item is numbered.
* Unordered lists are used when we don’t have any specific order for the list item and hence each item is bulleted.
* Level 1 ordered list points are marked numerically while level 2 points are marked with letters.
* Level 1 unordered list points are dashed while level 2 points are marked with a bullet.

**Length**

Generally, lists should be used to present simple pieces of information. For more complex sets of data, consider using a data table.

**Order**

Arrange list items in a logical way. For example, if the list is about resource use, the default order might be highest resource use to lowest. Grouping items in categories into smaller, more specific lists might be more meaningful in some contexts. Alternatively, organize in alphabetical or numeric order.

# **Accessibility**

* Use List when you are displaying more than two items or points.
* To present a grouping of simple, related information. For more complex data.
* To break up related content into easily digestible chunks.
