## **General Guidance**

Links are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., view more, show all).

A link is a control or a text piece that, when clicked, takes the user to\
another page.\
\
Link text should always be meaningful, descriptive without relying on\
other text.\
\
Links are for navigation and buttons are for taking actions they are to be\
used in different context.





## **Behaviour**

A link state is essentially how a link looks at different points of interaction.\
There are 6 states a link can have\
\
**enabled** - The normal state is how a hyperlink will usually appear.\
\
**hover** - The hover state is when a user uses a mouse over the link and it\
changes state to let the user know that the link is clickable.\
\
**focus** - The focus state is when the user uses the Tab key to navigate\
\
**active** - The active state is how the link will appear immediately after being\
clicked\
\
**disabled** - The disabled state is when a link is unclickable and unusable.
