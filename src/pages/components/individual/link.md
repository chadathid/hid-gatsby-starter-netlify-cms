  A link or hyperlink is an HTML object that allows users to access a web
  page or other online content when they click or tap it. Websites use links
  as a way to navigate the web or to move within a site.

# **Guidelines**

Links are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., view more, show all).

A link is a control or a text piece that, when clicked, takes the user to another page.

Link text should always be meaningful and descriptive without relying on other text.

Links are for navigation and buttons are for taking actions they are to be used in different contexts.

# **Behavior**

A link state is essentially how a link looks at different points of interaction.

There are 6 states a link can have

**enabled** - The normal state is how a hyperlink will usually appear.

**hover** - The hover state is when a user uses a mouse over the link and it

changes state to let the user know that the link is clickable.

**focus** - The focus state is when the user uses the Tab key to navigate

**active** - The active state is how the link will appear immediately after being
clicked

**disabled** - The disabled state is when a link is unclickable and unusable.

# **Accessibility**

* Do not mix the usage of links and buttons
* Avoid using Link to perform actions other than navigation or accessing external pages. 
* Link should serve a navigation purpose.
* Make sure all links are unique and descriptive
* Images of text in links should be avoided, use actual text instead.
* Highlighting URL destinations.
* Use bold font-weight in link elements such as lists, profile and board names, and any link element that an underline style isn't necessary to convey interactivity.
