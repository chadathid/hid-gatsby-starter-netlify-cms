# **Guidelines**

Links are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., view more, show all).

A link is a control or a text piece that, when clicked, takes the user to another page.

Link text should always be meaningful and descriptive without relying on other text.

Links are for navigation and buttons are for taking actions they are to be used in different contexts.

# **Behavior**

A link state is essentially how a link looks at different points of interaction.

There are 6 states a link can have

**enabled** - The normal state is how a hyperlink will usually appear.

**hover** - The hover state is when a user uses a mouse over the link and it

changes state to let the user know that the link is clickable.

**focus** - The focus state is when the user uses the Tab key to navigate

**active** - The active state is how the link will appear immediately after being
clicked

**disabled** - The disabled state is when a link is unclickable and unusable.
