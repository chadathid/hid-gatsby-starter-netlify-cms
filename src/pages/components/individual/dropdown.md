# **Guidelines**

* Include a label associated with the content of the dropdown to guide the user in choosing the appropriate value from the list.
* The values within a dropdown list should be sorted in a logical order that is easily scannable.
* Use a dropdown menu when you need to give users 3 or more options to choose from.

  **Do not use**

  When there are fewer than 3 options to display, use radio buttons or checkboxes instead.
