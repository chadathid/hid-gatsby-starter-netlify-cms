# **Guidelines**

* Use Tooltip to further clarify a label or element.
* To help explain why the system needs to collect their data.
* To help the user complete a task.
* To guide the user through a new flow or feature which they have not used before.

**Usage**

* Tooltips appear on hover, focus, or touch, and disappear after a short duration.
* Tooltips should include short and descriptive text.
* If the tooltip includes a title, set it in sentence case. Titles can wrap as needed.
* Tooltips should only appear when the user hovers over the element and should not immediately disappear unless the user hovers over another element.
* When the tooltip appears on the page, make sure the focus is on the tooltip, this helps users of assistive technology read the content.
