title: Progress bar
description: >-
  Progress bar is a graphical element that provides feedback to the user
  regarding the percentage of tasks completed. They inform how much progress is
  complete and how much remains while completing a task.

  This gives people feedback about progress and is helpful for estimating the amount of time before a task is completed.

# **Guidelines**

Use loading progress bars to represent a percentage of the task completed or to the show progress of an activity, process, or task.

* Use labels to clearly describe the process that's in action.
* Inform the user how far along he/she is in the process as this will give them a sense of control.
* The progress bar should be supported by a label and the value of progress usually a percentage or ratio such as Percentage (20%) or fraction (2 of 8)

**When to use**

Use the progress bar for the longer process as it conveys information about how much time is remaining and this information gives users control.

**Do not use**

When the estimated time to complete a process is unknown, such as to signify that something is loading. Use a Loader instead.

Do not use the progress bar for complex tasks with steps involved, such as onboarding or payment flow. Use Progress Stepper instead.
