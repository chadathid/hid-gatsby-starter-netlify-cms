# **Guidelines**

* Use notifications to inform users of important status changes and updates
* Limit action labels to two words or less.
* Be descriptive and give users clear next steps. Keep the message under two lines.
* Do use clear and concise language.
* Do not use technical jargon or language unfamiliar to the user.
* An actionable notification should persist until the user dismisses it, allowing users time to interact with the notification.
* Use only one Call to action button per notification.

**When to use**

**Line notification** - For notifications that are relevant to a piece of content on the page, use Inline Notifications.

**Toast** - For notifications that are temporary and need to provide visual feedback, use Toast Notifications.

# **Variants**

Notification status helps convey the information being communicated. These statuses correspond with color and icon to provide a consistent, universal experience for users.

**Informational** - When a relevant action happens in other parts of the application.

**Error** - When an action a user initiate has errors.

**Warning** - For information that the users must immediately be made aware of.

**Success** - When an action the user activated is successful.
