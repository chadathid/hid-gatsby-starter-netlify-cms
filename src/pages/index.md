    - title: "Design System: For Designers"
      text: When a Product Designer (UX and UI Design) they now have a substantial and
        ever-growing library of things like buttons, input fields, tables,
        typefaces, and colors to utilize when creating hi-fidelity mockups. This
        will be a never-ending process of adding more and more design elements
        and enhancing existing ones to meet the wide variety of use cases needed
        for HID customers. The list and basic snapshots of those design elements
        are represented on this site, but they use our Figma design files to
        access and utilize the actual components. Specifics on this can be found
        on the "Getting Started" page of this website.
    - title: "Pattern Library and CSS: For Engineers"
      text: >
        Most scrum teams across HID and the various BAs (Business Areas) work
        hand in hand with a Product Designer, but that's not always the case.
        Anyone building applications, with or without the benefit of a designer,
        can use this site to review and understand our company's UI styles.
        There are currently two methods for them to actually enable our styles
        in their code (more detail on the Getting Started page of this site).
        For teams using React, we have partnered with our talented colleagues in
        Chennai, India to build the RPL (React Pattern Library). Our goal is to
        provide the building blocks for developers to build applications without
        "reinventing the wheel" every time. For teams that don't use React, we
        also offer a CSS library that will at least enable them to style their
        UI with the same intuitive and clean manner as other HID software.
        Again, refer to the Getting Started page for details.
    - title: "Design System: For everyone else"
      text: >
        Because designers will largely use our Figma files to acquire all of our
        UI components, and engineers will either leverage React libraries or
        CSS, it seemed like a good idea to showcase all of our HID Design System
        in a more user-friendly format here on this site. For instance if the QA
        team for a given product wants to validate the UI they're checking, they
        can easily find those elements here and see how they should display and
        how they can be used in our software. Another important aspect is
        Accessibility. This is an area that we are currently working to expand,
        but for instance our UI styles need to meet certain contrast ratios for
        persons with vision limitations. As we continue to deepen the HID Design
        System you will see more information about we endeavor to meet or exceed
        ADA and W3C standards for accessibility.

T﻿hink of our Design System as visual language through which cross-functional teams across HID Global can empower our users with clear and consistent User Interface and Patterns. All of the UI components, widgets and our responsive grid system not only provide users with intuitive and consistent interactions across BAs, products, and user roles--this system provides Engineers/Developers and Scrum Teams an efficient way to build software with less churn (back and forth with designers and other teams). You may be familiar with some established, open source systems like IBM's Carbon and Google's Material Design. 

**N﻿ote:** In the spirit of agile methodologies, our current Design System and Pattern Library (and this website by extension) is very much at V1.0. We have created MVPs for testing and gained valuable feedback from some internal beta testers. We are launching this V1.0 even as we've started working on the next iteration! Things like mobile app UI (mobile web apps, iOS Apple native, and Android native) are well underway.
